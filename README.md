# 3d sketches + experiements

A place to keep sketches and demos of various things I'm trying out in 3D game-esque formats.

Example of the kind of thing I'm making here:

In-browser demo: https://cube.ameo.design/

## tech

Most of the stuff here is built using Blender, Three.JS, and some custom shaders.  It will all run in the browser, targeting desktop devices with mouse + keyboard.  SvelteKit is used as a lightweight framework for wrapping everything up and bundling releases.

In the future, may include audio integration that is generated in realtime also in the browser using my [web-synth](https://github.com/ameobea/web-synth) project.
