## CGAL Wasm

This is the CGAL (computational geometry algorithms) library compiled to Wasm.

I used this Github repo as the base to get it building: https://github.com/ademola-lou/3DLibrary/tree/master

I then had to make a bunch of tweaks to fix download URLs, work around compiler incompat, and other stuff.  You can find it all in my fork here: https://github.com/Ameobea/cgal-wasm-wrapper
